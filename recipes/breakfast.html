    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 Tbsp oil</li>
      <li>1 8" flour tortilla</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 red bell pepper</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp diced green chiles</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp pepper</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp salsa</li>
      <li>1 green onion, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Brush the olive oil over the inside surface
        of a circular baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the tortilla down into the baking dish so that the edges fold up
        the sides of the dish. It may help to microwave the tortilla for a few
        seconds first to make it more pliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle 1/2 of the shredded cheddar into the bottom of the tortilla.
        Dice the bell pepper and add it on top of the cheese along with the
        diced green chiles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crack four eggs into the dish on top of the vegetables and cheese.
        Season with a pinch fo salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Top with the remaining shredded cheese.</li>
      <li>
        Bake the eggs for about 20 minutes, or until the whites are set and the
        yolks are still a bit liquid. You can shake the dish a bit to easily see
        how much the eggs are set.
      </li>
      <li>
        After baking, spoon a couple tablespoons of salsa over the tortilla
        baked eggs and sprinkle the sliced green onion over top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Loosen the tortilla by sliding a knife around the edge between the
        tortilla and dish, then slide the tortilla baked eggs out of the dish
        and use a large knife to cut it into quarters. Serve hot and enjoy!
