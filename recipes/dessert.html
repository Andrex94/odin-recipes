    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
      <li>2 cups chopped peaches (about 2 peaches)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp brown supar</li>
      <li>1 14oz. can sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel and chop your peaches into small pieces (smaller pieces "float" in
        the whipped ice cream instead of sinking to the bottom). Add the butter
        and chopped peaches to a skillet and sauté over medium-low for about 5
        minutes, or until the peaches have softened. Make sure the butter does
        not brown during this step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the brown sugar and balsamic vinegar to the skillet. Turn the heat
        up to medium and sauté for about 5 minutes more, or until the balsamic
        vinegar has reduced to a glaze. Set the balsamic peaches aside to allow
        them to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sweetened condensed milk to a medium bowl and stir in the
        vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using either a whisk, a hand mixer, or a stand mixer, whip the heavy
        whipping cream to stiff peaks in a separate bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a large dollop of the whipped cream to the bowl with the sweetened
        condensed milk. Fold the ingredients together to lighten up the
        sweetened condensed milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/3 of the lightened sweetened condensed milk back to the bowl with
        the whipped cream and gently fold them together. Repeat that two more
        times until all of the sweetened condensed milk has been folded into the
        whipped cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the whipped ice cream mixture into a 2-quart, freezer safe
        container. If your container is deep (like a bread pan), add half of the
        whipped mixture first, top with half of the balsamic peaches, then
        repeat. If using a wider shallow dish (like the baking dish in my
        photos), you can do one layer of whipped ice cream and then just top
        with the balsamic peaches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a spatula to lightly swirl the balsamic peaches into the whipped ice
        cream mixture. Do not over stir here. You want distinguishable ribbons
        of balsamic glaze. Just run the spatula through the mixture once.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the dish and freeze the ice cream for 8 hours, or until solid,
        then serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
